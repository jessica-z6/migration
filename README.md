"Constrained Migration" is a compelling digital installation that explores the theme of migration within imposed limits. It features a virtual simulation of a group dynamically migrating, encapsulated in a transparent glass box. This setup symbolizes the illusion of freedom, where the entities, though appearing autonomous, are actually restricted within their digital confines. The artwork is a metaphor for the often unseen boundaries that govern natural behaviors, challenging the viewer to discern the fine line between perceived independence and actual confinement. This thought-provoking piece invites reflection on the constraints that subtly shape natural and societal movements.
